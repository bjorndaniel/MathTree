# MathTree
A Ooui-based math quiz using a Raspberry Pi 3D-xmas tree for visual feedback
Will generate 24 random questions and when a correct answer is given the field will turn green and the corresponding light will turn on.
When all 24 questions are correct the tree will start blinking until the "BÃ¶rja om"-button (restart in swedish) is clicked.
If run on a machine without gpio-pins output will be to the console.
